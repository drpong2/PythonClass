rubric

Grading isn't finalized, but the things I'll be looking for:
Does the program run
does it load the auth module (if you're confused by this, skip it or submit two programs)
Can you run the control loop for apps
can you run the control loop for user perms
does the menu return correctly
does the program end correctly

Things I expect to see in your code
	functions
	while loops
	if loops
	lists
	module imports
	
This is to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.

You can zip all your files up and submit them, or submit all the code (clearly commented) inside of a text file.
