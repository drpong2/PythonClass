The below is Pseudo-code. It should not be copied directly, but used as a guide for writing your own program.

username = input("Please enter your username: ")

password = input("Please enter your password: ")


itemlist = ["item 1", "item 2", "item 3"]

userauth = {'steve': 'opensesame'}

def checkpassword(username, password):
	tries = 3
	while tries > 0:
		if userauth[username] == password
			login
		else:
			tries -= 1
			password=input(f"Password incorrect! {tries} remaining\nEnter password: ")

#Using functions for flow control of your app is recommended
#the following functions are ones I was planning on using:
#	getroles(), listapps(), login()
#the below may give some insight on how to use them.
#Remember, the goal of this exercise is "flow control" - How do you give users options and manage where they are within your program?


Functions also make your code easier to test and debug. When the bulk
of your program’s work is done by a set of functions, each of which has a
specific job, it’s much easier to test and maintain the code you’ve written.
You can write a separate program that calls each function and tests whether
each function works in all the situations it may encounter. When you do
this, you can be confident that your functions will work properly each time
you call them.
